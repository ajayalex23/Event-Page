   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splash! is one of Europe's biggest hip hop and reggae festivals. It first took place in 1998,
    in the inner city of Chemnitz, Germany. The next year, the location of the festival changed to the Oberrabenstein reservoir near the city, where it remained through 2006. In 2007 and 2008, the festival was held on the Pouch peninsula in Bitterfeld. In 2009, the festival moved to the Ferropolis in Gr√§fenhainichen, which remains the official site.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early years, there were two stages; one each for hip-hop and reggae. In 2006, the festival extended to six stages and four party tents. In addition to hip-hop and drum and bass DJs, the tents also house dancehall and reggae sound systems, a graffiti contest and ITF matches.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name "Splash" hints at both the waterside location, and the phrase "to make a splash".
